## üìã Project Backlog & Estimations

### Overview
The Project Backlog feature generates comprehensive project management artifacts including user stories, estimations, and implementation roadmaps based on either conversation context or uploaded architecture images.

### How to Use

#### From Conversation (Build a Solution tab)
1. Complete the solution building conversation
2. Navigate to the "Project Backlog" tab in the options
3. Click "üìã Generate Project Backlog & Estimations"

#### From Architecture Image (Modify Architecture tab)
1. Upload an architecture diagram image
2. Navigate to the "Project Backlog" tab
3. Click "üìã Generate Backlog from Architecture"

### Backlog Structure
The generated backlog includes a comprehensive table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Iniciativa** | High-level initiative groupings (e.g., "Infrastructure Base", "Security", "Monitoring") |
| **Componente** | Specific technical components (e.g., "API Gateway", "Lambda Functions", "RDS Database") |
| **√âpica** | Epics that group related user stories |
| **User Story - Capacidad** | User stories in "As a [user], I want [functionality] for [benefit]" format |
| **Estimaci√≥n puntos de usuario** | Story points using Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) |
| **Estimaci√≥n Horas** | Time estimates converted from story points (1 point = 4-6 hours) |
| **Prioridad** | Priority levels: Alta (High), Media (Medium), Baja (Low) |
| **Definici√≥n de User Story** | Detailed acceptance criteria and "Done" conditions |

### Project Summary
Each backlog includes a comprehensive project summary:

#### üìä Total Estimations
- **Total Story Points**: Sum of all story points
- **Total Estimated Hours**: Sum of all time estimates
- **Estimated Duration**: Project timeline based on typical team size

#### üìà Priority Distribution
- Breakdown of story points and hours by priority level
- Helps with sprint planning and resource allocation

#### üéØ Implementation Phases
- **Phase 1 - MVP**: High priority items for initial delivery
- **Phase 2 - Core Features**: Medium priority enhancements
- **Phase 3 - Optimizations**: Low priority improvements

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations & Risks
- Critical dependencies identification
- Technical risks assessment
- Mitigation recommendations

#### üë• Team Recommendations
- Suggested team composition
- Required skills and roles
- Recommended team size

### Coverage Areas
The backlog generation covers all aspects of AWS solution implementation:

- **Infrastructure Configuration**: For each AWS service identified
- **Network Setup**: VPC, subnets, security groups
- **Security Configuration**: IAM, encryption, compliance
- **Application Development**: Lambda functions, APIs, business logic
- **Data Configuration**: Databases, storage, backup strategies
- **Monitoring & Logging**: CloudWatch, alerting, dashboards
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Deployment automation
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, load testing
- **Documentation**: Technical docs, runbooks, architecture documentation

### Features
- **Downloadable Backlog**: Export as Markdown file
- **Additional Tools**: Tips for CSV export, sprint planning, estimate refinement
- **Feedback System**: Rate the usefulness of the backlog
- **S3 Storage**: Automatic storage of generated backlogs

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Analysis Widget (`architecture_analysis_widget.py`)
- Uses Amazon Nova Pro for image analysis and text generation
- Supports JPG/PNG image formats
- Converts images to base64 for API transmission
- Implements streaming response for real-time feedback
- Includes comprehensive error handling

### Backlog Estimation Widget (`backlog_estimation_widget.py`)
- Generates backlogs from conversation context or architecture images
- Uses structured prompts for consistent output format
- Implements Fibonacci estimation scale
- Provides realistic time conversions
- Includes project management best practices

### Integration Points
- **Layout Updates**: New tabs added to `layout.py`
- **Main Application**: Integration in `agent.py` with proper state management
- **Styling**: Uses existing custom styles from `styles.py`
- **Utilities**: Leverages existing S3 storage, feedback, and streaming functions

## üîß Configuration

### Model Configuration
Both features use the Amazon Nova Pro model (`amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`) configured in:
- `utils.py`: `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID`
- Temperature settings optimized for each use case:
  - Architecture Analysis: 0.3 (balanced creativity and accuracy)
  - Backlog Generation: 0.2 (more structured and consistent output)

### State Management
- Session state variables prevent duplicate API calls
- Proper state isolation between different features
- Persistent storage of generated content

### Error Handling
